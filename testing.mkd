**Electrical**

* Must be powered via a USB port
* Must be able to pair from Android phone, Android tablet, iPhone and a PC with
  a Bluetooth adapter with a default pre-arranged passcode (1234 is fine)
* Must appear as an A2DP device to all Bluetooth connections
* Audio stream quality must be imperceptibly different from SYNC Bluetooth (i.e.
  vs Bluetooth iJoey to SYNC aux-in port) (e.g. no pops or clicks, not overly
  compressed, no EQ compression)
* LED activates when powered
* A separate LED activates when paired and transmitting audio, or the color of a
  single LED changes
* Stream audio for 12 hours and record all disconnections and transmissions
  errors
* Run through 100 connect/disconnect cycles, looking for failures to connect, or
  any instance in which the Bluetooth stack becomes out of sync
* Must be capable of a reasonable amount of gain (added after the fact) (0xE,
  -6dB works well with SYNC)

**Physical**

* iJoey must be able to go through 100 attach/detach procedures with the k-board
  with no visible wear

**Mechanical**

* Cast urethane parts, designed for injection molding --> Constant wall
  thickness, appropriate minimum thickness material (0.050" for ABS), draft
  angles, slide consideration
* Robust attachment and mating features between housing pieces
* Assuming a K-Board installed into a 2012 Focus cup holder, BT iJoey must fit
  appropriately in provided space
